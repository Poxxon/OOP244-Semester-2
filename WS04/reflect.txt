Working on the Canister project was a challenging yet rewarding experience. Initially, I struggled with ensuring that the canister was marked as unusable only when necessary. Debugging and comparing my output with the expected results revealed subtle issues in the setContent and pour methods. Through persistence and attention to detail, I discovered that the key was accurately handling content names and checking usability. Updating the setContent method to address these checks correctly resolved the issue. This project taught me the importance of precise logic and thorough testing. It was a valuable learning process that improved my problem-solving skills and deepened my understanding of C++ programming. Overall, this experience highlighted the significance of patience and meticulousness in software development, leading to a successful outcome and a better grasp of object-oriented programming concepts.
