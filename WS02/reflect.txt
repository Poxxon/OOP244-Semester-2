In this workshop, I focused on dynamic memory management, function overloading and the use of references. I learned how to allocate and deallocate memory for array of Employee with its structures using the new and delete keywords to make sure the memory is managed properly and avoid 'leaks'. Overloading the functions load and display gave me more practice with this function that allows us to have difference instances of the same name functions that do totally different things with different parameters but still can share the same name, which can really help with flexibility of the program. Handling references was a familiar concept since we also had experienced referencing by pointers and addresses. Using bool load(Employee& employees) was where it shined the most being able to reference everything with their address gives me peace of mind to be sure the information saved will not be lost and not take much space rather than coping and passing by value. Handling read and open/close functions as well was a not very new experience as we have done it on C as well. It however gave me more practice with the concept and we'll be getting more efficient in this topic. Overall WS02 reinforced what we've learnt in our lectures and by more or less experiencing what C had to offer but with a lot more functionalities that C++ brings, to prepare us for what this course has to offer.
