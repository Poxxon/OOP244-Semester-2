In this workshop on Object-Oriented Programming, I've gained a comprehensive understanding of class implementations and interactions. The files, including Car.cpp, Employee.cpp, Student.cpp, and their headers, illustrate class design, constructor usage, and operator overloading. The main.cpp tester program initializes arrays of Car, Student, and Employee objects and uses the Collection template class to manage these objects, demonstrating encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. Each class encapsulates specific attributes and methods, showcasing key OOP principles. The Car class manages car details, the Employee class handles employee records, and the Student class tracks student information. The Collection template allows flexible handling of different object types, highlighting the power of templates in C++. The ReadWrite interface class and its operator functions emphasize the importance of polymorphism and standard I/O operations. Overall, this exercise reinforces fundamental OOP concepts and practical C++ programming skills.
