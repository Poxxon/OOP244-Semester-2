During this session, we tackled challenges related to uninitialized values and formatting inconsistencies in the Bill and Item classes, which were causing errors and improper output. To resolve these issues, we implemented setEmpty() methods in both classes to ensure all member variables were set to known states and modified constructors to call these methods. We used valgrind to detect uninitialized values, making iterative changes based on its outputs to ensure proper initialization. For formatting, we utilized iostream and iomanip libraries to control the output format, setting column widths and aligning text correctly. This process highlighted the importance of initializing variables to prevent undefined behavior and runtime errors. The effective use of debugging tools like valgrind proved invaluable in identifying and resolving issues. Attention to detail in formatting ensures user-friendly interfaces and accurate data presentation. This experience reinforced the need for good coding habits, thorough testing, and an iterative approach to problem-solving. Moving forward, I aim to continue practicing these habits, using debugging tools effectively, and deepening my understanding of C++ to handle future assignments with greater confidence.
