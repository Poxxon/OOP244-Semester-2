This workshop was quite a ride! Diving into the Text and HtmlText classes, I got a real hands-on experience with the rule of three and dynamic memory allocation. At first, understanding the rule of three was a bit tricky, but it makes so much sense now. Ensuring that copy constructors, assignment operators, and destructors are properly implemented helped me see how to manage resources effectively, especially when dealing with dynamic memory. The HtmlText class was particularly interesting since it added an extra layer of complexity with the HTML formatting. One of the biggest challenges was making sure the dynamically allocated memory was handled correctly to avoid leaks. Debugging those memory issues was a bit of a headache, but it was satisfying to finally get it right. Overall, this workshop was a great way to solidify my understanding of these concepts, and I feel more confident in my coding skills. Looking forward to the next one!
