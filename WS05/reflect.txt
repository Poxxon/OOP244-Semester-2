During this project, I encountered several challenges and learned valuable lessons that enhanced my understanding of C++ programming and debugging. Initially, I faced issues with missing files and incorrect declarations. By carefully analyzing the compiler error messages, I realized the importance of maintaining correct file paths and ensuring consistency between function declarations and definitions. Specifically, I had to correct the redefinition of the operator= function and fix syntax errors in Account.cpp. Another significant learning point was understanding the proper use of operators in class definitions. Implementing and debugging the operator=, operator+=, and operator-= functions helped solidify my grasp of operator overloading in C++. This experience also underscored the value of systematic debugging and code review. By breaking down the error messages and methodically addressing each issue, I was able to resolve the errors and achieve a working solution. Overall, this project reinforced the importance of attention to detail, consistent coding practices, and the iterative process of debugging and testing in software development.
